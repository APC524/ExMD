## Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

### Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
The following open-source programs must be installed in order to work with this project:
* g++       (Version 5.3 or newer)
* python    (Version 2.7)
* CMake     (Version 2.8 or newer): https://cmake.org/
* Paraview  (Version 5.1.2 or newer): http://www.paraview.org/
* Doxygen   (Version 1.8.3 or newer): http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

## Building the Project <a name="build_project"></a>
From the project root folder, create a new directory called "build":

    mkdir build/

change directory to the "build" folder, and build the project using cmake:

    cd build/
    cmake ..

this will generate the necessary Makefile to compile all the source code. Compiling the source code is simply done by typing "make" in the "build" folder:

    make

### Custom Targets
There are a number of custom targets that become available, depending on which flags are set when building the project with cmake. The list below shows all the available targets, each of which will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

* **cmake ..**
    * make vtk [Used for generating visualization files after simulation]
    * make doc [Used for generating project documentation]
* **cmake -Dexample=ON ..**
    * make example [Used for generating project examples]
* **cmake -Dtest=ON ..**
    * make test [Used for running unit tests]
* **cmake -Dstyle=ON ..**
    * make test [Used for running unit tests and style check]

**Ex.:** running `cmake ..` from the "build" folder makes the custom targets **'vtk'** and **'doc'** available. Running `cmake -Dexample=ON ..` makes **'vtk'**, **'doc'** and **'example'** available, etc.


## Examples
The project comes with a couple of examples that show some of the features that have been implemented. These examples become available when the project is build with the '-Dexample=ON' flag. From the "build" folder type:

    cmake -Dexample=ON ..

Then, the examples can be generated by typing:

    make example

Three examples are generated:
* Example 1: Elastic collisions
* Example 2: Gravity
* Example 3: Flocking

The visualization files are automatically generated. For more information and instructions on how to visualize the examples, please take a look at the associated wiki-page: https://github.com/APC524/ExMD/wiki/Visualizing-the-Examples

## Usage

### Input

### Simulation

### Visualization

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
The project includes several features for testing the source code. It has two unit testing suits, for C++ and Python, and also a style checker for C++.

These testing features can be activated by building the project with the appropriate flags. From the "build" folder, type:
* **Unit tests:**

    cmake -Dtest=ON ..

* **Unit tests + Style check**

    cmake -Dstyle=ON ..

In both cases, the target **'test'** will become available, which means that testing can be performed by first running 'make' and then 'make test' in the build folder:

    make
    make test

Running 'make test' generates output that looks something like:
* **Unit tests:**

        Running tests...
        Test project /Users/brosten/Desktop/temp/ExMD/build
            Start 1: CppUnitTests
        1/2 Test #1: CppUnitTests .....................   Passed    0.02 sec
            Start 2: PyUnitTests
        2/2 Test #2: PyUnitTests ......................   Passed    0.62 sec
        
        100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2
        
        Total Test time (real) =   0.65 sec

* **Unit tests + Style check**

        Running tests...
        Test project /Users/brosten/Desktop/temp/ExMD/build
            Start 1: CppUnitTests
        1/3 Test #1: CppUnitTests .....................   Passed    0.02 sec
            Start 2: PyUnitTests
        2/3 Test #2: PyUnitTests ......................   Passed    0.50 sec
            Start 3: GoogleStyle
        3/3 Test #3: GoogleStyle ......................   Passed    1.14 sec
        
        100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 3
        
        Total Test time (real) =   1.66 sec

Where each of the tests listed here are in fact test suits, which can be inspected further by typing:

    ctest -V -R <name_of_test>

**Ex.:** `ctest -V -R CppUnitTests` will show explicitly all the unit tests within this test suit.

Additionally, if any of the tests suits were to fail; running the above command with the name of the relevant test suit would explicitly show which tests are failing and what must be corrected in order for the test suit to pass.

### Intro to Google Testing <a name="intro_gtest"></a>

## Documentation <a name="documentation"></a>
The project is documented automatically using Doxygen. This documentation can be accessed through the custom target **'doc'**. By typing

    make doc

in the "build" folder, the documentation will be generated. The pdf-version of the documentation can then be created by going to "build/doc/latex" and running `make` from within this folder, assuming that latex is installed. This produces a file named 'refman.pdf', which is the pdf-version of the project documentation.
